In May, his father arranged for him to meet Rajkumar Sharma. Upon the suggestion of their neighbours, Kohli's father considered enrolling his son in a professional cricket academy, as they believed his ability merited more than gully cricket. He was unable to secure a place in the U-14 Delhi team, due to extraneous factors. His father reportedly received offers to relocate his son to influential clubs, which would ensure his selection, but he declined the proposals. Kohli eventually found his way into the U-15 team. He received training at the academy and participated in matches at the Sumeet Dogra Academy located at Vasundhara Enclave. In pursuit of furthering his cricketing career, he transferred to Saviour Convent School during his ninth-grade education. On 18 December 2006, his father died due to a cerebral attack.

However, his debut innings was a brief one, as he was dismissed after scoring ten runs. In the subsequent match against former champions, Karnataka, Delhi found themselves trailing with a score of 130/5, with Kohli remaining unbeaten on 40 at the end of the day's play. That night, Kohli's father died. Despite the heart-wrenching news, Kohli returned to the match and continued to bat and scored 90 runs before he was dismissed. Chetan Chauhan, the coach, was impressed by his determination and unwavering attitude in the face of adversity. Venkatesh Prasad lauded his crucial knock, which was executed in the midst of an emotional upheaval. After his dismissal, Kohli attended his father's funeral. His innings proved to be crucial for Delhi as they were able to avoid the follow-on. The team's captain, Mithun Manhas, praised Kohli for his performance, acknowledging its pivotal role in the team's success.

He averaged 105 in the three-match ODI series against England Under-19s, while also averaging 49 in the 3-match Test series. Following India U-19 success in both the ODI and Test series, the team's coach Lalchand Rajput noted Kohli's adeptness in facing both pace and spin bowling and expressed his admiration for his technical prowess. In September, the U-19 team toured Pakistan. In the first Test match, Kohli scored 63 and 28 as India won by 271 runs against Pakistan Under-19s.

In the following month, the team travelled to Malaysia for a tri-series against England Under-19s and Sri Lanka Under-19s, where Kohli did not get many opportunities to bat. In July–August, India U-19 embarked on a tour for a tri-series against Sri Lanka Under-19s and Bangladesh Under-19s, where he did not score a half-century in any of the matches. He made a comeback with scores of 144 and an unbeaten 94 in the following Test series.
Kohli came into the limelight in 2008 when he led the team to victory in the  U-19 World Cup. He led the Indian squad and won the 2008 U-19 World Cup held in Malaysia. He amassed 235 runs at an average of 47, ranking as the tournament's third-highest scorer and one of three cricketers to compile a century. His century, a knock of 100 runs off 74 balls, versus the West Indies Under-19s in a group stage encounter, was lauded by ESPNcricinfo, as "the innings of the tournament." This innings paved the way for India's 50-run triumph and fetched Kohli the man of the match award. Additionally, Kohli's all-round performance in the semi-final against New Zealand Under-19s, where he captured 2 wickets and contributed 43 runs in the run-chase, was core to India's victory. In the championship match, Kohli managed a score of 19 against South Africa Under-19s and his contribution lead to the eventual 12-run win (via D/L method).
In June 2008, Kohli and his U-19 teammates Pradeep Sangwan and Tanmay Srivastava were awarded the Border–Gavaskar scholarship. This scholarship, aimed at honing the skills of the chosen cricketers, provided an opportunity to train for six weeks at Cricket Australia's Centre of Excellence in Brisbane. In a bid to identify potential talent for the senior team, Kohli was selected to represent India Emerging Players in the Emerging Players Tournament 2008. His finest performance in the tournament was against New Zealand Emerging Players, where he played a knock of 120 runs, leading India to a seven-wicket victory. With an aggregate of 204 runs, Kohli's performances did not go unnoticed by the selectors who were observing his progress. He began his international cricket journey by joining the senior team in Colombo, having played 28 Under-19 ODIs and 12 Under-19 Tests.


== International career ==

Kohli's international career began in August 2008 when the 19-year-old had a "surprise call-up" to the ODI squad for a tour of Sri Lanka. He opened the batting due to injuries to senior players, scoring his first half-century in the fourth match. After a brief stint with the India A team, he scored a century against a strong Australian bowling line-up in a tour match. Despite an early BCCI contract, Kohli's place in the team was not secure. A turning point came in the 2009 Emerging Players Tournament in Australia, where he was the top run-scorer, leading his team to victory with a century in the final. This performance cemented his return to the national side. He scored his maiden ODI century in December 2009 against Sri Lanka. By early 2010, he became the third Indian to score two ODI centuries before turning 22.

In 2010, Kohli was appointed vice-captain for a tri-series in Zimbabwe and became the then fastest Indian to score 1,000 ODI runs. After a dip in form during the 2010 Asia Cup, he solidified his position with consistent performances, finishing as India's leading ODI run-scorer for the year. Kohli played a crucial role in India's 2011 World Cup victory, scoring a century on his debut and a 35 in the final. Further made his Test debut in June 2011 against the West Indies, but struggled initially and was dropped. He was recalled and eventually found his footing, scoring his maiden Test century in Adelaide in January 2012. He continued to score runs in ODIs, with an unbeaten 133 against Sri Lanka and a career-best 183 against Pakistan in the 2012 Asia Cup, being the standout performances.
By 2013, Kohli was a linchpin of the Indian batting line-up, particularly in run-chases. He played a key role in India's 2013 Champions Trophy win and was appointed captain for the first time during a tri-series in the West Indies, where he scored his first century as skipper. He later established several records, including the fastest ODI century by an Indian. After a difficult tour of England in 2014 where he averaged 13.4, Kohli regained form and was named the full-time Test captain following MS Dhoni's retirement during the tour of Australia. In his first series as permanent captain, he scored three centuries in his first three innings, totaling 692 runs, the most by an Indian batsman in a Test series in Australia. He also remained consistent in the T20 format, earning the Man of the Tournament award at the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 for his 319 runs in the tournament. 

Kohli's form in the lead-up to the World Cup was not at his best, however after a strong start to the 2015 World Cup with a century against Pakistan, Kohli's tournament ended with a score of 1 in the semi-final loss to Australia. A subsequent dip in form was followed by his first Test series win as captain in Sri Lanka. From 2016 to 2018, he entered a peak phase of his career. In 2016, he was the Player of the Tournament at the ICC World T20. He became the first batsman to score double centuries in four consecutive Test series and was appointed captain for the 2017 Champions Trophy, where India finished as runners-up. This period saw him break numerous records, including becoming the fastest to 8,000, 10,000, and 11,000 ODI runs. In 2018, he became the No. 1 ranked Test batsman and led India to first-ever Test series victory in Australia. By 2019, he became India's most successful Test captain, holding the ICC Test Mace for five consecutive years. He scored his 70th international century in November 2019, but this was followed by a prolonged lean patch. From 2020 to 2022, Kohli struggled for runs and stepped down from the T20I, ODI, and Test captaincy in succession.
Kohli's return to form began at the 2022 Asia Cup, where he scored his maiden T20I century, his first in any format in over 1,000 days. He was the highest run-scorer at the 2022 T20 World Cup, playing a impactful innings of 82* against Pakistan. His peak resurgence came at the 2023 World Cup on home soil where he was named the Player of the Tournament for scoring a record 765 runs in a single edition. During the tournament, he scored his 50th ODI hundred, surpassing Tendulkar's long-standing record. In next year's T20 World Cup; Kohli had a lean tournament, however delivered a player of the match performance in the final, scoring 76 as India won the trophy. Following the victory, he announced his retirement from T20 Internationals. In the 2025 Champions Trophy, Kohli was instrumental in India's victory, scoring a century and becoming the fastest to 14,000 ODI runs. India later secured the title. On May 12, 2025, after poor Border-Gavaskar Trophy performances he announced that the  Test-series would be his last, marking his retirement from Test cricket.


== Franchise career ==
In the inaugural 2008 Indian Premier League season, Royal Challengers Bangalore, then owned by Vijay Mallya, acquired Kohli for $50,000 following his performances in the Under-19 World Cup. Kohli managed one run in the opening match against Kolkata Knight Riders and initially struggled in the middle order. A brief promotion to the top order in a match against the Deccan Chargers offered a glimpse of form, but he soon returned to his original position. He concluded the season with 165 runs, as Bangalore finished seventh in the league standings. In the 2009 season, Kohli began with a series of low scores but found form with a half-century in the third match. Despite limited opportunities, he made crucial contributions, notably in the semi-final victory over Chennai Super Kings. However, he was dismissed for 7 in the final, as Bangalore lost to Deccan Chargers by eight runs, finishing as runners-up.
The 2010 season saw Kohli elevated to the role of vice-captain. He emerged as a reliable middle-order batter and an athletic fielder, with a notable 58 against the Deccan Chargers. Bangalore reached the playoffs but were eliminated by Mumbai Indians in the semi-final, where Kohli was again dismissed for 7. In the 2010 Champions League T20, he delivered key performances, scoring 47 and 49* to help Bangalore reach the semi-finals before falling to Chennai. Ahead of the 2011 season, Kohli was the sole player retained by Bangalore for $1.8 million. After a steady start, he hit peak form with a string of impactful innings, including a half-century and consecutive Player of the Match awards. He also stepped in as captain during Daniel Vettori’s absence and earned praise for his leadership. Bangalore topped the league table and advanced to the final, where Kohli contributed 35 runs in a losing cause. He concluded the season with 557 runs, finishing as the second-highest run-scorer.

In the 2012 IPL season, Kohli experienced an inconsistent run, beginning with low scores before registering a few significant innings, including an unbeaten 73 against Delhi Daredevils as part of a then-record 203-run partnership with Gayle. Midway through the season, he assumed captaincy from Vettori but could not guide Bangalore into the playoffs, with the team falling short in their final league match. Kohli ended the campaign with 364 runs and expressed dissatisfaction with his performance, acknowledging the need for improvement. Promoted to full-time captain from the 2013 season, Kohli began with an unbeaten 93 and successive half-centuries, briefly taking his team to the top of the table. However, a mid-season slump, coupled with inconsistent bowling performances, derailed their campaign. Despite Kohli's individual scores, including a 99-run innings, Bangalore failed to qualify for the playoffs. Retained for ₹12.5 crore ahead of the 2014 season, Kohli endured one of his most challenging campaigns. Although he began with an unbeaten 49, his form deteriorated with a series of low scores and multiple ducks. Attempts to revive his form by opening the innings proved ineffective, and he registered only a single half-century in his twelfth match. With Bangalore heavily dependent on Kohli and Gayle, the team lost six of their first nine matches and was eventually eliminated from playoff contention. Kohli ended the season with a 73 against Chennai.
In the 2015 season, Kohli opened the batting for Bangalore alongside Gayle and maintained consistent returns, scoring 505 runs in 16 matches at an average of 45.90. His notable performances included an 82-run innings as part of a then-record 215-run partnership with AB de Villiers against Mumbai, and an unbeaten 44 in a rain-shortened fixture against Hyderabad. Under Kohli’s captaincy, Bangalore reached the playoffs but were eliminated in Qualifier 2 by Chennai. The 2016 season marked a significant phase in Kohli’s career. He began with a series of half-centuries and registered his maiden T20 century against Gujarat. Despite a slow start to the campaign, Bangalore staged a strong recovery, with Kohli scoring four centuries over the course of the tournament. He finished the season with a record 973 runs at an average of 81.08, claiming both the Orange Cap and the Most Valuable Player award. Bangalore reached the final but lost to Hyderabad by 8 runs. 
At the onset of 2017 season, Kohli missed the opening three matches due to a shoulder injury but returned with a 62-run innings against Mumbai. Despite adding a few more half-centuries, Bangalore endured a difficult campaign, including being dismissed for league record of 49 against Kolkata. Kohli cited the team’s lack of intent and conservative approach as key concerns. Bangalore were eliminated early, finishing at the bottom of the table, with Kohli scoring 308 runs in 10 innings. That same year, he was named in ESPNcricinfo’s all-time IPL XI as part of the league’s tenth-anniversary recognitions. Ahead of 2018, Kohli was retained for ₹17 crore, making him the most expensive player at the time. He crossed the 500-run mark for a record fifth time and briefly held the Orange Cap, but Bangalore failed to advance beyond the league stage. Heavy reliance on Kohli and de Villiers, alongside an underperforming bowling unit, contributed to their early exit. The 2019 season began with Kohli moving down the order, a tactical change that did not yield the desired results. He later returned to form with a century and finished the season with a series of improved performances, but Bangalore had lost their first six matches and again failed to reach the playoffs. Kohli acknowledged the late improvement but pointed to ongoing issues in the middle order, leading to increased scrutiny over his long captaincy tenure.

Between 2020 and 2022, Kohli experienced mixed outcomes in the IPL. In the 2020 season, after a slow start, he delivered several steady innings that helped Bangalore qualify for the playoffs. However, his conservative strike rate and early dismissal in the eliminator contributed to the team's exit. In 2021, he began positively and reached multiple individual milestones, including becoming the first player to play 200 matches for Bangalore and surpassing 10,000 runs in T20 cricket. Midway through the season, Kohli announced his decision to step down from captaincy at the end of the campaign. Bangalore again reached the playoffs, but Kohli’s dip in form coincided with the team’s elimination. In 2022, under new captain Faf du Plessis, Kohli faced a prolonged lean patch, recording multiple low scores and three ducks, which is the joint-highest in a single season of his career. His struggles drew criticism from analysts and led to suggestions of taking a break from cricket. He responded with a 73-run innings in a must-win match that secured Bangalore a place in the playoffs, but failed to make a significant impact in the knockout games. The season concluded without a title, extending championship drought.
In the inaugural match of 2023 season, Kohli began with an unbeaten 82 against Mumbai and maintained steady form, registering five half-centuries in the first eight matches. His approach combined early aggression in the powerplay with a more measured tempo through the middle overs. He also briefly captained the side in Faf du Plessis’s absence. Despite ending the season with back-to-back centuries, surpassing Gayle’s record for most IPL hundreds. Bangalore failed to secure a playoff spot. Kohli concluded the campaign with 639 runs at an average of 53.2 and a strike rate of 140. Further in 2024, Kohli played in rhythm, scoring several fifties and a career-best unbeaten 113 against Rajasthan, though it came in a defeat. Bangalore recovered from a six-match losing streak with a six-match winning streak to enter the playoffs, with Kohli contributing significantly, including a notable 92 off 47. He ended the season with 741 runs at 61.75, earning the Orange Cap for the second time. In the 2025 IPL season, Kohli scored 657 runs in 15 innings at an average of 54.75 and a strike rate of 146.5, finishing as the tournament's third-highest run-scorer. In the final against Punjab Kings, he contributed 43 runs off 35 balls as Bengaluru posted 190/9, eventually winning the match by six runs. The victory marked the franchise’s first IPL title, ending an 18-year wait. It was also Kohli’s first IPL championship in 18 seasons with the team.


== Player profile ==


=== Playing style ===

Kohli is considered as an enterprising batsman, possessing technical abilities and a dynamic playing demeanour. His customarily batting position in ODl cricket is at number three, with a slightly open-chested stance, and a resolute grip on the bottom handle of his bat. He has been noted for his agile footwork, expansive range of strokes, and his propensity for adeptly orchestrating innings whilst thriving in high-pressure situations. In his batting technique, Kohli tends to favour playing grounded shots rather than attempting big hits. He is appreciated for his ability to execute wrist shots and his consistent prowess in the mid-wicket and cover region. Kohli has often expressed his admiration for the cover drive, which he considers to be his signature stroke. He possesses a natural aptitude for the flick shot, particularly when facing deliveries aimed towards leg stump. Having a limited recourse to the sweep shot, Kohli's batting technique is characterized by an emphasis on ground shots that primarily yield runs in the regions between deep square leg and mid-on. Kohli is known for his composed batting technique and versatility in his play. He scores runs between long-off and long-on with an aligned bat, while also possessing the ability to display a destructive streak. His combination of bat-speed and supple wrist movements enable him to craft innovative angles that disrupt traditional field positioning. Kohli is also a proficient fielder, recognized for his quick reflexes and sure-handedness.
However, Kohli has a known vulnerability to deliveries that are wide of the off-stump. Bowlers often exploit this weakness by targeting him with such deliveries, especially in Test and ODl matches. This vulnerability has resulted in Kohli's dismissal on numerous occasions. Former New Zealand cricketer Richard Hadlee has also noted that Kohli is particularly susceptible to out-swinging deliveries.
Kohli has garnered widespread acclaim and recognition as a preeminent limited-overs batter by cricketing experts and aficionados alike. In ODIs, he boasts an average of 65.5 runs when batting second and 51.7 runs when batting first. He has amassed 28 of his 51 ODI hundreds in run-chases, and holds the record for the most hundreds scored when batting second. In reference to his success while batting second, Kohli has expressed a fondness for the challenge of chasing, relishing the opportunity to test himself and demonstrate his ability to efficiently manage strike rotation and execute boundary hits. His colleagues admire his self-assurance, dedication, concentration, and work ethic, which are the driving forces behind his success.


=== Aggression ===
Kohli's playing style is widely regarded as aggressive, a trait that extends to his leadership on the field. He is known for his passionate and animated responses to on-field situations, demonstrating a fierce competitiveness. His captaincy is characterized as proactive, taking bold decisions and leading the team by example. Kohli has been the subject of much media scrutiny and criticism in the early stages of his career. He was often portrayed as a brash and arrogant individual, eliciting mixed reactions from fans, critics and former cricketers alike. While some have praised his assertiveness and confidence, others have criticized Kohli's behaviour for crossing the boundaries of fair play and for losing control, sometimes resulting in a loss of composure. Despite his efforts to curb his aggressive behaviour, Kohli has acknowledged that there are times when intense pressure or high-stakes situations may challenge his resolve. Nevertheless, the cricketer has persistently maintained that his aggression acts as a source of inspiration and drives his focus and motivation on the field. Writing for The New York Times, Huw Richards noted Kohli's self-assuredness and "assertiveness" in contrast to some former Indian cricketers who he felt had exhibited an inclination towards excessive politeness and reticence, and that Kohli embodies his combative demeanour both on and off the cricket field.


=== Comparisons to Sachin Tendulkar ===
Kohli's batting style and approach to the game have frequently drawn comparisons to Sachin Tendulkar, who he regarded as the epitome of excellence in cricket. Dubbed as Tendulkar's "successor", he is widely considered to have the potential to surpass his records in the future. His reverence for Tendulkar as a role model, who he idolized in his formative years and sought to emulate, is well-documented. Nevertheless Indian commentator Aakash Chopra has notes that Tendulkar possessed a broader array of shots.
In a discourse with Bollywood actor Salman Khan, Tendulkar proclaimed that Kohli possesses the potential to surpass his record of 100 international centuries. Tendulkar also acknowledged Kohli's batting aptitudes and the steadfastness with which he has accumulated runs. In 2013, Tendulkar retired from international cricket, Kohli, who played alongside Tendulkar in the team, honoured him by presenting him with a sacred thread that had been gifted to him by his late father. Tendulkar eventually returned the thread to him, imploring that it should remain in his possession.

=== Personal life ===

Kohli's romantic association with Bollywood actress Anushka Sharma, which commenced in 2013, earned the duo the moniker of "Virushka". During an interview with Graham Bensinger, Kohli divulged that he had encountered Sharma for the first time, when they were both were engaged in a promotional shoot for Clear shampoo. Their union since then has attracted significant media interest, with persistent rumours and speculations swirling around in the press, as both parties remained reticent about publicly discussing the relationship. On 11 December 2017, the couple exchanged nuptials in an intimate ceremony held in Florence, Italy, becoming one of the most talked-about celebrity couples in the country. On 11 January 2021, the couple had their first child, a daughter, who was named Vamika. On 15 February 2024, the couple welcomed their second child, a boy named Akaay.
In 2018, Kohli disclosed that he had made the decision to adopt a vegetarian diet in an effort to alleviate the symptoms of a cervical spine issue caused by elevated levels of uric acid. This condition was impacting his finger movements, and thus, affecting his performance as a batsman. He made a conscious effort to abstain from consuming meat, as part of his regimen for maintaining optimal health. He has since clarified that his dietary choices do not align with a vegan lifestyle and he continues to consume dairy products. Kohli is widely recognized for his physical fitness and intense training regimen. He has been an advocate of leading a healthy lifestyle, which involves regular exercise and a nutritious diet. His hard work and discipline in this area have earned him the reputation of being one of the fittest cricketers in the world.
Kohli has acknowledged a belief in superstitions, and owns various lucky charms and rituals that he feels bring him good fortune on the cricket field. This includes wearing of black wristband and a single pair of gloves. Furthermore, Kohli has been observed sporting a kara, a traditional bangle often worn for religious or spiritual purposes, on his right arm since 2012. In addition to the previously mentioned superstitions, Kohli has also established the ritual of consistently donning white shoes on the cricket field. He has a number of tattoos, including of the Hindu deity Shiva, the names of his parents, and his ODI and Test match cap numbers.


=== Commercial investments ===
Kohli made his initial business foray by becoming a co-owner of the Indian Super League club FC Goa. He also ventured into the fashion industry, partnering with Anjana Reddy's Universal Sportsbiz to launch WROGN, a brand focused on men's casual wear. Rounding out his ventures in 2014, Kohli became both a shareholder and brand ambassador for Sport Convo, a social networking platform designed to bring sports fans together.
The following year, saw a expansion of his portfolio. Kohli made a investment of ₹90 crore (US$11 million) to establish "Chisel," a chain of health clubs and fitness centers across India, a joint venture with Chisel India and Cornerstone Sport and Entertainment. His interest in sports franchises continued as he became a co-owner of the UAE Royals in the International Premier Tennis League and the Bengaluru Yodhas, a Pro Wrestling League franchise. In 2016, Kohli helped launch Stepathlon Kids, an initiative aiming to encourage children to adopt healthy lifestyles. The year 2017 proved to be particularly active for his brand-building efforts. He partnered with Puma to introduce his athletic lifestyle brand, One8.  Diversifying into the hospitality sector, Kohli established Nueva, a fine-dining restaurant in New Delhi, and later that year, he launched One8 Commune, a chain of restaurant bars, marking his inaugural venture into the food and beverage industry.
Kohli's investments continued in 2019 with an investment in Galactus Funware Technology Pvt Ltd, the parent company of Mobile Premier League (MPL). Early in 2020, Kohli and his spouse, jointly invested ₹2.5 crore in Digit, an insurance-based startup. The year 2021 saw him become an athlete-investor and ambassador for Hyperice, a wellness brand known for its recovery products.  He also extended his support to Blue Tribe, a startup specializing in plant-based meat products. Additionally, Kohli invested an undisclosed amount in Rage Coffee, a coffee brand, and was appointed its brand ambassador. Most recently, in May 2025, Kohli made significant moves in the sports and athleisure market. He joined the sports athleisure brand Agilitas as an investor, concluding his eight-year contract with Puma. In the same month, he also became a Strategic Investor in the World Bowling League (WBL).


=== Philanthropy ===
In 2013, Kohli established the "Virat Kohli Foundation," a philanthropic organization dedicated to supporting underprivileged children. The foundation collaborates with various non-governmental organizations (NGOs). One of its early initiatives was in 2014, when it participated in a charity auction organized by eBay and Save the Children India.
To raise funds, the foundation has organized several high-profile charity events. Among the most notable are the "Celebrity Clasico" football matches, which pit Indian cricketers against Bollywood actors. In 2016, the foundation partnered with the Smile Foundation to support education for underprivileged children, hosting a charity dinner at the Grand Hyatt in Mumbai to raise awareness and funds for the cause. The foundation's scope expanded later that year when Kohli partnered with the ABIL Foundation to aid senior citizens in old-age homes.
In 2017, he extended his efforts internationally, hosting a gala dinner in London to support the Justice and Care organization ahead of a Champions Trophy match. The same year marked the establishment of the Athlete Development Programme (ADP), created to support promising young athletes with guidance in coaching, training, fitness, and nutrition. Golfer Aadil Bedi is one of the notable athletes who has benefited from this initiative. To support the ADP, the foundation also partnered with the RP-Sanjiv Goenka Group to host a celebrity golf tournament, with the proceeds directly funding the program.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Kohli and his wife, made notable contributions. In 2020, they pledged donations to the PM CARES Fund and the Maharashtra Chief Minister's Relief Fund. In 2021, amidst India's severe second wave, they organized a fundraising campaign on Ketto titled '#InThisTogether'. Starting with a personal donation of ₹2 crore, the campaign surpassed its initial goal and ultimately raised over ₹11 crore for COVID relief efforts. Later in the year, the foundation further diversified its work by collaborating with the Awaaz Foundation to establish a rehabilitation center for stray animals in Mumbai. Kohli has noted that this initiative was inspired by his wife's passion for animal welfare.
